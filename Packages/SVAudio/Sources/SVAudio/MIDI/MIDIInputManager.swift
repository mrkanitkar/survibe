/// ## Architecture: nonisolated I/O manager
///
/// This class is **not** `@MainActor`. CoreMIDI is a hardware I/O framework
/// that invokes all of its callbacks on its own internal threads:
///
/// - `MIDIClientCreateWithBlock` notify block — "called on an **arbitrary thread**;
///   thread-safety is the block's responsibility." (Apple documentation)
/// - `MIDIInputPortCreateWithBlock` read block — "called on a **separate
///   high-priority thread** owned by CoreMIDI." (Apple documentation)
///
/// Making the class `@MainActor` would cause Swift 6 to insert
/// `dispatch_assert_queue(main_actor_queue)` checks at every `self?` access
/// site inside `@Sendable` closures. CoreMIDI fires those closures on its own
/// threads, so the assertion always fails → `_dispatch_assert_queue_fail` /
/// `brk #0x1` crash.
///
/// The correct architecture (per Apple docs and Swift 6 concurrency):
/// - The I/O manager itself is a plain `nonisolated Sendable` class.
/// - All mutable state is protected by `NSLock`.
/// - Observable UI state (`isConnected`, `connectedDeviceName`) is annotated
///   `@MainActor` so the compiler verifies they are only **read** on the main
///   actor and only **written** via `Task { @MainActor in }`.
/// - CoreMIDI callbacks capture `[weak self]` directly. Because `self` is not
///   actor-isolated, Swift 6 inserts **zero** actor-isolation checks —
///   no bridging, no relay, no crash.
///
/// ## USB Connection (Yamaha PSR-400 and other class-compliant keyboards)
/// iOS treats USB MIDI devices as standard CoreMIDI sources — no special
/// entitlements or drivers required. When the keyboard is connected, CoreMIDI
/// fires `.msgObjectAdded`; `refreshSources()` re-enumerates and connects the
/// new source.
