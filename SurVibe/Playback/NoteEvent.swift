/// A unified note event for play-along mode, bridging Sargam/Western notation
/// and MIDI data into a single timeline-ready format.
///
/// NoteEvent is the central data model for the play-along pipeline. It converts
/// heterogeneous song data (notation JSON or MIDI binary) into a uniform sequence
/// of timed, identifiable notes that drive both the visual display (falling notes,
/// scrolling sheet) and the scoring/detection engine.
///
/// ## Two Construction Paths
/// - ``fromNotation(sargamNotes:westernNotes:tempo:)`` — converts beat-based
///   notation arrays into absolute-second timestamps (used by 17/19 seed songs).
/// - ``fromMIDI(events:)`` — wraps parsed MIDI events, deriving Swar names from
///   MIDI note numbers (used by 2/19 seed songs with binary MIDI data).
///
/// ## Swar Name Contract
/// The ``swarName`` property always stores the **full** Swar name including
/// modifier prefix (e.g., "Komal Re", "Tivra Ma"), not just the base note.
/// This matches the format returned by `SwarUtility.frequencyToNote()` and
/// `PitchResult.noteName`, ensuring correct comparison in pitch detection.

    let midiNote: UInt8

    /// Full Swar name including modifier (e.g., "Sa", "Komal Re", "Tivra Ma").
    ///
    /// This is the canonical name used for pitch detection comparison.
    /// Must match the format from `SwarUtility.frequencyToNote()`.
