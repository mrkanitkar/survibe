/// 2. Evaluates gate status for each step type (intro = always unlocked, etc.)

/// 4. Persists step completion and time spent via `LessonProgressManager`
/// 5. Transitions to `.completed` when the final step is finished

/// ## Step Gating Rules
/// | Step Type | Gate Behavior |
/// |-----------|---------------|
/// | intro     | Always unlocked |
/// | read      | Always unlocked |
/// | listen    | Locked until `listenCompleted()` called |
/// | sing      | Locked until `singCompleted(accuracy:)` >= 0.60 or manual advance |
/// | exercise  | Locked until `exerciseCompleted()` or manual advance |
/// | practice  | Locked until `exerciseCompleted()` or manual advance |
/// | quiz      | Locked until `quizCompleted(score:)` called |
