/// Orchestrates song loading (dual-path: MIDI or notation), real-time playback
/// scheduling, pitch detection, scoring, and wait mode. All state is @Observable
/// for efficient SwiftUI binding.
///
/// ## Two Loading Paths
/// 1. **MIDI binary** — 2/19 seed songs provide raw MIDI data parsed via `MIDIParser`.
/// 2. **Notation arrays** — 17/19 seed songs store JSON-encoded `SargamNote`/`WesternNote`
///    arrays converted to `NoteEvent` via `NoteEvent.fromNotation(...)`.
///
/// ## Playback Scheduling
/// Uses `ContinuousClock`-based drift-corrected timing via the injected
/// `ClockProviding` dependency. A 30 Hz display-link task updates `currentTime`
/// for smooth UI scrolling.
///
/// ## Scoring
/// Each note attempt is scored via `NoteScoreCalculator` from SVLearning.
/// Session-level aggregates (stars, XP, streaks) use `PracticeScoring`.
///
/// ## Wait Mode
/// When enabled, `PlayAlongWaitController` pauses playback at each note
/// until the user plays the correct pitch.
