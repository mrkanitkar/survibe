/// Off-main-actor engine that evaluates a MIDI or microphone note input against the
/// currently expected note event and returns a `ScoringDiff`.
///
/// ## Why an Actor
/// `processNoteInput` in `PlayAlongViewModel` ran on `@MainActor`, competing with
/// SwiftUI's render passes for falling notes and piano key highlights. At 200 BPM
/// with 16th notes, MIDI events arrive every ~75 ms — faster than SwiftUI can render
/// and score simultaneously on one actor. Moving all scoring arithmetic here lets
/// `@MainActor` focus on UI work; the scoring result is a tiny `ScoringDiff` that
/// hops back to update `@Observable` state.
///
/// ## Thread Safety
/// All inputs to `evaluate` are `Sendable` value types (structs, enums, primitives).
/// No shared mutable state is accessed; the actor serializes concurrent calls so
/// back-to-back rapid keypresses are evaluated in order without races.
///
/// ## Wait Mode
/// `PlayAlongWaitController` is `@MainActor`-isolated and cannot be passed here.
/// Instead, the caller evaluates the wait-mode match on `@MainActor` first and
/// passes the result as `waitModeMatch: Bool?` (nil = wait mode disabled).

    /// Evaluate a note input against the expected event and return a scoring diff.

    /// All parameters are `Sendable` value types — no actor hop required to pass them.
    /// The returned `ScoringDiff` is consumed on `@MainActor` to update `noteStates`,
    /// `noteScores`, and `accuracy`.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - midiNote: MIDI note number of the input (0–127).
    ///   - expectedEvent: The note event currently under evaluation.
    ///   - currentPitch: Latest pitch detection result for cents deviation, or `nil`.
    ///   - ragaScoringContext: Raga-aware scoring context, or `nil` for 12ET.
    ///   - waitModeMatch: `true` if wait mode matched, `false` if wait mode active but
    ///     no match, `nil` if wait mode is disabled (standard scoring applies).
    /// - Returns: A `ScoringDiff` describing the state and score delta.
