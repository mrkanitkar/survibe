/// Decouples MIDI key-highlight state from the SwiftUI render cycle.
///
/// ## Problem this solves
/// At 120–140 BPM, notes arrive every 107–125 ms. A note-on followed by a
/// note-off can both complete within a single 16 ms SwiftUI frame, so the key
/// never visually highlights. Additionally, dispatching every MIDI event through
/// `Task { @MainActor }` adds unpredictable delay when the main actor is busy
/// re-rendering the piano keyboard, falling-notes view, or scoring HUD.
///
/// ## Solution
/// - A 128-element note-state buffer protected by `OSAllocatedUnfairLock` is
///   written **directly on CoreMIDI's high-priority thread** — no actor hops,
///   no Task queuing.
/// - A `CADisplayLink` fires every display frame (~8–16 ms) on the main thread,
///   reads the buffer under the lock, and publishes `activeNotes: Set<Int>` only
///   when the set changes — preventing unnecessary SwiftUI re-renders.
/// - An **80 ms minimum visual hold** is enforced per note so fast staccato
///   playing (e.g. Sa-Sa-Sa at 140 BPM) always produces a visible flash,
///   matching the behaviour of Simply Piano and Yousician.
///
/// ## Thread safety
/// - `rawNoteState` is a fixed-size array of 128 `Bool` inside an
///   `OSAllocatedUnfairLock`. Reads and writes from any thread are serialised
///   by the lock (hold time is a single array subscript — nanoseconds).
/// - `noteOnTimes`, `pendingOff`, `activeNotes` are only accessed on the main
///   thread inside `displayLinkFired` — no additional locking needed.
